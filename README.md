# PhoneDojo

This is an application that allows users to upload phones and review them. It uses **express** as a server and **mongo** as a database I made this app to showcase my node skills. You can run the app live [here](https://cryptic-depths-42340.herokuapp.com/). 

## Install
```
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```
Then visit: http://localhost:8080/

**Note:** Don't forget to add your environment variables in the ``.env`` file. Populate ``DATABASE_URL`` with a mongo database url.

## Features

- Error handling
- Security: content security policy, cross site scripting prevention etc.
